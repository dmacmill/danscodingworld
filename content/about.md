# About Me

I'm a Software Dev in Massachusetts, who's worked on robotics and backend projects.
Robotics meaning I've worked on a full range of problemsets, from ML to middleware 
to embedded to systems design.

I write these posts for a bunch of reasons. Documenting my findings in sort-of 
online diary entries is one reason. Another is committing more to coding for fun and 
not just because it pays the bills. Another is to occasionally post what's on my mind. 
Y'know, blog stuff.
