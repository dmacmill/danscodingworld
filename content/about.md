# About Me

{{<figure src="./../imgs/circletriangle3.png"

I'm a Software Dev in the Greater Boston area, who's worked on backend,
frontend, devops, and embedded programming.

I document my findings in these sort-of online diary entries. These posts are
also a way for me to spend more time seeing coding as an enjoyable thing and not
just because it pays the bills. I might just occasionally post what's on my
mind.  Y'know, blog stuff.
